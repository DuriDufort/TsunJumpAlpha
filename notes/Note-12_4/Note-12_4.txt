Font Notes

fPixelHangul
Found a pixel font online that supports Korean characters, if font size is greater than 11 it will become blurry
Must scale text using font_text_transformed, if done this way must adjust margins in oText so that the text will match the size of the text box

Main Menu
Need to make variables more human readable
Add resolution options and functionality to game menu - graphics
- closely followed tutorial - Menus from FriendlyCosmonaut on youtube

Start Screen/Main Menu
Not certain if we should use a multi slot save system or single file
Need to test hidden menu items
Test drawing save/load slots if multi slots will be used
if not need to test saving and loading data at start screen so that hidden menu's will appear when going to Main Menu
need to test resetting saved data when new game is selected and a save file of player and scroll grid exists
Should also implement a warning that the save data will be over wrtitten when a new game is created

- Potentially add a new game+ feature so that game can be experienced again while retaining hidden menu

Implement hidden menu where all scrolls that have been collected so far are displayed 
- Show all scrolls available in game
- Gray out any that have not been collected
- Allow player to use arrow keys to hover over collected scrolls which will not be grayed out
- When hover Player should see the senders name somewhere on the screen and after pressing enter display the scroll's message
	- either draw the message over the screen or to the right on a side bar
- Potentially allow mouse controls, when hovering over a scroll that has been collected display sender name
- When right click display message

Alternatively only show hidden menu when game has been completed
allow player to see hidden menu even when new game+ selected

Plan to add

- Jump buffer to player character

- focus camera on doors when transitioning from locked to unlocked state
- subtle screen shake

- cutscenes for first room - tutorial room, and last room - sonaria celebtration scene

Tutorial Room
	- Create room ith tutorial messages and scroll for the player to learn game controls
